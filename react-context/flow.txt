Click sign up so that the path changes. IF the path ends in
signup, react directs user to the sign up page. Within the sign
up page, user is asked to input username and password
since path is signup, there will be a message that says
'create an account to get started'
when this page load the react element, AuthForm also gets triggered
As user is tying username and password, those two credentials are being saved
once submitted, a json is created with a post method, headers, and a json stringify
object with the username and password
the client witl call fetch  passing in the location /api/auth/signup and the req data
as a result , the client sends username and password to the server,
 the server checks if there is a username and a password
 if there isnt either of the two, a 400 error code is given.

 If there is a password and username, argon2 hashes the password
 the username and hashed password are then stored in the DB
the hash will then change to sign in, which will take user to the sign in page

User can sign in
